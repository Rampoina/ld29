Theme: Beneath the surface.


What is the surface?

    - the ground/water
        beneath it:
        - creatures that inhabit it
        - treasures

    - an object
        beneath it:

    - an apple
        beneath it:
        - worms (ew)

    - abstract interpretation
        
        - there is something more to it than it is apparent 


What do you want there?
    
    - find something 

    - store something?

    - discover the world there

    - you control the world beneath the surface

    - it's just the scenario for the game


Types of games:

    Puzzle Game?
        - Minesweeper (LOL)

    Sim. Way too hard

    digging for treasure. 
        - with a hook or something that goes down vertically
            okay but already done and boring (ex ridiculous fishing) 
        
    RPG

    survival game

    wackamole (strike those sons of bitches that stick their heads out of the
    ground lol)


    snake the worm is playing snake inside an apple




Final game idea:

The scenario is a planet apple, but space worms are coming to devour it.
You control a guy that goes around the planet placing defenses, or whacking
the worms on the head if they come out!.
You can't let the worms reach the core or you lose.
Diferent rounds.

So basically it's a weird tower defense game (I guess)
