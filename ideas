Theme: Beneath the surface.


What is the surface?

    - the ground
        beneath it:
        - dwarfs/ants other creatures
        - treasures

    - the water
        beneath it:
        - sea creatures?
        - more treasures (yaaay)

    - an object
        beneath it:

    - an apple
        beneath it:
        - worms 

    - abstract interpretation
        
        - there is something more to it than it is apparent 


What do you want there?
    
    - find something 

    - discover the world there

    - you control the world beneath the surface



Types of games:

    Minesweeper (LOL)

    Sim. Way too hard

    digging for treasure. 
        - with a hook or something that goes down vertically
            okay but already done and boring (ex ridiculous fishing)
